## 🛠️ About Me

Hello, I’m Steven — also known as `stevefox-linux`.  
I'm a full-stack system developer with 5+ years of hands-on experience in building, deploying, and automating business-critical applications.

From warehouse barcode integrations to report generation systems powered by **FastAPI**, **JasperStarter**, **Linux automation**, and **DevOps pipelines**, I design solutions that work hard in the background — so people don’t have to.

## 🛡️ Dev Philosophy

> *“Build clean, deploy clean, and automate repeatables.”*

I believe in systems that quietly do their job.  
I build with discipline, test before deploy, and secure every layer.
